# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# poem = Poem.create(poem: "To be, or not to be, that is the question:\n
#     Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\n
#     The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\n
#     Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,\n
#     And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep")
# pizza = Word.create(name: "Pizza")
# rainbow = Word.create(name: "Rainbow")
# frank = User.create(name: "Frank")
# UserWord.create(user: frank, word: pizza)
# UserPoem.create(user: frank, poem: poem)

# frank.words << rainbow
